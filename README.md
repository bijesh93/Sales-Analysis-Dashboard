# Sales Analysis Dashboard  

## Project Overview  
The **Sales Analysis Dashboard** is a comprehensive project designed to analyze sales data, uncover trends, and provide actionable insights for decision-making. This project demonstrates data analysis skills using SQL Server and Excel, showcasing the ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights through queries and visualizations.

## Tools Used  
- **SQL Server**: To query, clean, and analyze the dataset.  
- **Excel**: To create an interactive dashboard with pivot tables and charts.  

## Dataset  
The dataset is based on a sample Superstore sales dataset, which includes information on orders, customers, products, and sales performance across various regions.  

## Key Insights  
- **Top Regions**: Identified regions contributing the most to total sales.  
- **Best-Selling Products**: Analyzed top 10 products by sales volume.  
- **Monthly Sales Trends**: Tracked sales growth over time to identify peak periods.  
- **Category Performance**: Evaluated sales by product categories and subcategories.  

## SQL Queries  
The following queries were used to extract insights:  
1. **Total Sales by Region**:  
   - Analyzed total sales across different regions.  
2. **Top 10 Products by Sales**:  
   - Identified products generating the highest revenue.  
3. **Monthly Sales Trends**:  
   - Examined sales performance on a monthly basis.  
4. **Sales by Category and Sub-Category**:  
   - Assessed category-wise sales trends.  

All SQL queries are available in the `sql_queries & analaysis SQL queries` file.  

## Excel Dashboard  
The interactive dashboard includes:  
- **Bar Chart**: Total sales by region and top products.  
- **Line Chart**: Monthly sales trends.  
- **KPIs**: Key metrics such as total sales and average monthly sales.  
- **Filters**: Slicers to filter data dynamically by category or region.  

The Excel dashboard is available in the `Calcuations` file.



## How to Use  
1. **Run SQL Queries**:  
   - Open the `.sql` files in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).  
   - Execute the queries to generate analysis results.  

2. **View the Dashboard**:  
   - Open the `Calcuations.xlsx` file in Excel.  
   - Use filters and slicers to explore data interactively.  

## Key Findings  
- Region `West` contributed the highest sales, with $710219.6845 in total sales.  
- Product `Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier` was the top-seller, generating $61599.824 in revenue.  
- The highest monthly sales were observed in `2018-11`.
